# University Assignments

This repository houses a collection of my programming assignments completed during my university studies.

## FAST NUCES LAHORE

The repository is structured into folders representing each semester:

- **Semester 1:** Programming Fundamentals
- **Semester 2:** Programming Fundamentals and Object Oriented Programming
- **Semester 3:** Programming Fundamentals and Data Structures
- **Semester 4:** Database Systems
- **Semester 5:** Operating Systems and Software Construction and Development

Within each semester folder, you'll find:

- **Assignment folders:** Containing the source code and related files for each assignment.
- **Question papers:** PDF files or Word Documents with the original assignment instructions.
