Q2: Write a function processArray(arr, callback) that takes an array of numbers
and a callback function. The callback should either:
● Double the values if callback is double
● Find the square if callback is square
For example:
const numbers=[10,5,8,2,6]
processArray(arr, double)
Output: [20,10,16,4,12]
Q3: Given the array:
const students = [
{ name: "Ali", age: 22, marks: 85 },
{ name: "Ayesha", age: 20, marks: 92 },
{ name: "Bilal", age: 23, marks: 78 },
{ name: "Ibrahim", age: 22, marks: 76 },
{name: "Usama", age: 21, marks :80}
];
Write functions to:
1. Sort students by marks in descending order.
2. Return student names with marks greater than 80.
3. Return students older than 21.
Q4: Given the following HTML:

<input type="text" id="nameInput" placeholder="Enter name">
<button id="addButton">Add Name</button>
<ul id="nameList"></ul>
Write JavaScript that:
● Adds the entered name to the list (<ul>) when the button is clicked.
● Prevents empty inputs from being added.
